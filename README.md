# Disapedia - A discord bot that allows you to search wikis!
##

### Todo:
* Add comments to all methods/classes
* Create some sort of deployment scripts for docker etc (Koen will be looking at this)
* Complete spec for how the commands will interact within the discord client
* Add admin permissions so that they can set defaults and modify the core funtionality of the bot (Could make this based on roles... but would I need to define these in the config?)
*
